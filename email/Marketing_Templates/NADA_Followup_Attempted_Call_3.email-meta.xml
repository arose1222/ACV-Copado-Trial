    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName},

I am hoping that you have time within the next few days so I can take you through a demo of our product… and show you how to take advantage of the $100 credit that is waiting for you! Remember, this offer expires on March 15th and I don’t want you to miss out!

If you would prefer to have an ACV Territory Representative stop by and take you through a demo I can arrange that as well. I know they would be excited to meet you in person and learn more about your business needs.

If for some reason, you are not the right contact within your dealership for buying and selling wholesale cars, can you please refer me to the right person.

Thank you again for your interest in ACV Auctions.
