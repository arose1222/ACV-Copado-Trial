    <textOnly>Hi there {!Contact.FirstName},

I know you&apos;re busy so I&apos;ll keep this brief.


2020 has been a wild ride for all of us. Through all the madness, ACV has continued to work toward prioritizing our Independent dealers like you. Our goal has always been to keep more time and money in your pocket with a wholesale platform that provides transparency and trust. Are we perfect? Definitely not. But with your feedback, we’ve made some drastic improvements to our platform and we’re not even close to done.



I’ve loaded a $350 buy-fee credit onto your account, which you can use immediately. Give our auctions a look. Set some saved searches and we can bring vehicles to you. Looking for a specific car? Let me know, I can help!



We were founded BY a dealer FOR dealers like you. So if you have any questions or concerns with ACV, I would be more than happy to assist. The credit will expire October 31st, so check out the auctions here and feel free to call, text or email me with any questions!

Thank you! {!Contact.Account_Owner_TM__c}</textOnly>
