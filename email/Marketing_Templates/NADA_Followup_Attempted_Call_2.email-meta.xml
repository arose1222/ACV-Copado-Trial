    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName},

Sorry to keep missing you. I would still like to take you through a demo of our product and also have you take advantage of the $100 credit that we will be placing in your account. The credit will expire on March 15th and I donâ€™t want you to miss out!

Please call or email me back with your availability.

If you are not the right contact within your dealership for buying and selling wholesale cars, can you please refer me to the right person.

Thank you again.
