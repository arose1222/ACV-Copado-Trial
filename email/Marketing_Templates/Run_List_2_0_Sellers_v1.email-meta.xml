    <subject>Hey there, did you see tonight&apos;s Run List lineup?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey there! 
Just reaching out to remind you that cars are running today on our daily Run List at 6 pm EST. 

With our revamped Run List 2.0, you&apos;ll find that these cars are priced to sell and I wanted to make sure that you donâ€™t miss out.  Give the run list a look and set your proxy bids beforehand! 

If you have any questions or feedback, shoot me an email or give me a call. I&apos;m here to help! 

Thanks! {!Contact.IST_Account_Manager__c}</textOnly>
