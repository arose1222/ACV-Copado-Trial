    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName},

Thank you for taking time to stop by our booth at NADA last week. We appreciate your continued interest in ACV Auctions.

Do you have time this week to go through a short product demo? I would like to show you how it works and how it could impact your business. Please let me know what availability you have.

As a thank you for your interest we have a $100 credit that we would like to place in your account that you can use towards your first buy or sell.

Thank you again.
