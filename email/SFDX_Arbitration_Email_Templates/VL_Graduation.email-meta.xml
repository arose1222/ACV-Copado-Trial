    <textOnly>You&apos;ve gone through the prescreen process and completed 10 Virtual Lift reports successfully. Moving forward, your images no longer required pre-screening review and will be uploaded with your condition reports. We will periodically audit your images and consistent quality will be key in remaining certified for virtual lift image uploads.</textOnly>
