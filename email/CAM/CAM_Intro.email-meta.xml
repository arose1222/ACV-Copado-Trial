    <textOnly>Welcome to Concierge Service


We&apos;re glad to have you in our pilot program. Our team of Concierge Account Managers are here to be your single point of contact for your day-to-day operations within ACV Auctions. Here&apos;s a glimpse of some things we can assist with:


Quarterbacking issues that affect your daily activity

Being your single point of contact for negotiating deals that do not sell in the app

Assisting with buying vehicles on the platform


Your partnership is important to us, and we look forward to working closely with you to take your wholesale operation to the next level.  We will be working along side your Territory Manager to ensure white glove service. Located below, a single phone number and email address is provided to reach our team.

Located below is the information for your single point of contact.
