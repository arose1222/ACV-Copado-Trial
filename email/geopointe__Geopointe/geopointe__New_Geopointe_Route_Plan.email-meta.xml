    <textOnly>Hello {!geopointe__GP_Route_Plan__c.OwnerFullName}!

A Geopointe Route Plan has been created for you. This will automatically build routes for you on a daily basis, but before this can happen we need to know where the routes should start and finish, and what days you work.

Click the link below to finish setting up the Route Plan.
