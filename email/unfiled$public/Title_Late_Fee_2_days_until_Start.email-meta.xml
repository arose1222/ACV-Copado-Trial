    <textOnly>Hello,

Our office has yet to receive the title paperwork for {!Case.Vehicle_Year_Make_Model__c} {!Case.Vehicle_VIN_Last_6__c}, sold on {!Case.Auction_End__c}.

The title and any paperwork are due by {!Case.Title_Due_Date__c} to avoid a late fee. If ACV does not receive the title by {!Case.Title_Due_Date__c}, you will begin incurring a late fee of $25 for each calendar day late up to a maximum of $250.

If you have any questions, please reach out to {!Case.Seller_Territory_Manager__c} your Territory Manager.

Thank you,

Titles Team
