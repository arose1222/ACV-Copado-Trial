Dear {!Case.Seller_Contact__c}, 

Congratulations on your recent successful auction with ACV! We are so happy that we were able to facilitate this.

Weâ€™ve noticed that you have not yet sent in your title for the {!Case.Vehicle_Year__c} {!Case.Vehicle_Make__c} {!Case.Vehicle_Model_1__c} (VIN Number: {!Case.00N4B000001Ftr9}) associated with auction number: {!Case.Auction_Number__c}. Your case number is: {!Case.CaseNumber}.

To conclude the auction and transaction you need to provide the title immediately. At the end of the auction you should have received a shipping label. If you do not have this or have misplaced it, please contact me via email at {!Case.OwnerEmail} and I will be happy to send a replacement. 

Sincerely, 
{!Case.OwnerFullName}
