    <subject>New ACV Account Manager</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello There,
I wanted to reach out and introduce myself as your new ACV account manager. I&apos;ll be your main point of contact here and will be giving you a call in the next couple of days to learn more about how I can support you and your dealership. Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime or if there is a preferred number at which I can reach you.

Thanks,
