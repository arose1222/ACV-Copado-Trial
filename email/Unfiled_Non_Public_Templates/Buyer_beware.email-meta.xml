    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Each ACV Auctions™ inspected vehicle includes an unbiased condition report. When you bid on a car with us, you know what you’re getting. Our ACV “Ride, Drive, and Frame—Green Light Policy”, OBDII, and Paint Meter Reading assurance that each vehicle you purchase is exactly as described.


A few more reasons why ACV Auctions™ is the best way to purchase vehicle:

Free to sign up

There is no doubt your day is busy. I will call you today, and I’ll keep it brief. I look forward to speaking to you and answering any questions you may have. If you have a second, please watch the videos.

Sincerely,
