My name is Dan with ACV Arbitration. I will be assisting you on the claim for your   . Please reply directly to this email within 24 hours in order to be assisted. If applicable, respond with either a photo or video of the issue. We would also like to get an appointment set up for diagnosis as soon as possible at a reputable, 3rd party shop (Franchise dealership, AMCO, Continental, etc) if it is a mechanical issue. If you've had the vehicle inspected by a mechanic already, please send the diagnosis over to me in this email.  PLEASE NOTE THAT AN ESTIMATE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED IF THERE IS NO VERIFICATION OF THE ISSUE. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your business.​​​​​​​
