    <subject>48 Hour Notice: {!Case.Vehicle_Year_Make_Model__c}, VIN {!Case.Vehicle_VIN_Last_6__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,



Thank you for being a valued ACV user!



We need to let you know that, per ACV policy, the purchasing customer of {!Case.Vehicle_Year_Make_Model__c} VIN {!Case.Vehicle_VIN_Last_6__c} has opted to place their 48-hour notice to void the sale, because they have not received the title from the start date,{!Case.Date_Time_of_48_Hour_Notice__c}. Our policy states that ACV has until the end of business on {!Case.X48_Hour_Expiration__c} to receive the title in our office.


Please provide a current status or ETA and we will let the buyer know.


We also need to advise you that if the deal is voided for no title, the vehicle will be returned to you, under these conditions:


· ACV will arrange to have the vehicle removed from the purchaser’s location and transported back to your lot

· You will be invoiced for this cost


If you prefer to handle the transportation yourself, please advise ACV immediately so that we don’t dispatch transport and you do not incur unnecessary fees.


Please reach out to titles@acvauctions.com with any questions.


Thank you,


Titles Team
