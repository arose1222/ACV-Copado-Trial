    <textOnly>Hello,

I am reaching out as we have received the title for the vehicle listed below.  Upon receipt there was an error identified on the front of the title. The title or reassignment reads ACV Auctions as the purchaser, however ACV never takes possession of the vehicle, it always goes directly to the buyer. Please provide a Letter of Correction or new reassignment in order to correct the title. Attached is a copy of the title and a picture of the incorrect purchaser information.
Year/Make/Model:{!Case.Vehicle_Year_Make_Model__c}
VIN: {!Case.VIN__c}


Thank you.</textOnly>
