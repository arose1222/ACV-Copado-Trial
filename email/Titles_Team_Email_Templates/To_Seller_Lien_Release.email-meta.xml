    <textOnly>Hello,

I am reaching out as we have received the title for the vehicle listed below.  Upon receipt there was an error identified on the front of the title. A lien was recorded with BANK. Please provide a Lien Release from BANK as this is a required portion of this sale in order to transfer the ownership to the purchaser.

Year/Make/Model:{!Case.Vehicle_Year_Make_Model__c}
VIN: {!Case.VIN__c}

Attached is a copy of the title for your records and an overnight label to expedite this request.

Thank you.</textOnly>
