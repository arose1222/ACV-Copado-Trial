    <textOnly>Hello,
I am reaching out as we have received the title paperwork for the vehicle listed below,  however there was an error notated upon processing the title.

Year/Make/Model: {!Case.Vehicle_Year_Make_Model__c}
VIN: {!Case.vehicle_id__c}

A lien was recorded on the title from (LIENHOLDER) and repossession papers were attached in place of this lien being released. As there was non-disclosed repossession paperwork attached to the title, I would like to confirm if you are able to accept the title as is or if this needs to be sent back to the seller for additional correction.

Please confirm if you can accept the paperwork as is.

Thank you!</textOnly>
