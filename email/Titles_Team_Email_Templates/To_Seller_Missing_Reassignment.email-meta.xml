    <textOnly>Hello,

I am reaching out as we have received the title for the vehicle listed below.  Upon receipt there was an error identified on the title. It is missing the current reassignment from you to the purchaser. Please provide a new reassignment so we are able to transfer the ownership of the title to the purchaser.


Year/Make/Model:{!Case.Vehicle_Year_Make_Model__c}
VIN: {!Case.VIN__c}

Thank you.</textOnly>
